The proposed project seems feasible in the time left.

An aside would be privacy concerns. While displaying emails/phone numbers is
probably not a great idea, you should at least ensure that non-registered users
can't see that sort of information. Likewise, you ensure that those
non-registered users can't see profiles or anything either. This also applies to
the API (i.e. shouldn't be able to obtain information just be accessing an
endpoint directly -- should be authenticated).
